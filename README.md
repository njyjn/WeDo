## Development Guide

### Setup

This project runs on Pipenv

```shell
pip install pipenv
```

For the time being, this API is secured by Auth0. Visit [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com) for more information on how to set up your account.

Ensure that you have a `.env` file with the following structure

```env
AUTH0_DOMAIN={auth0_domain}.auth0.com
API_AUDIENCE={auth0_audience}
FLASK_APP=api.py
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgres://{username}@{host}:{port}/api
```

At first run, please create the database like so

```shell
psql {user}
CREATE DATABASE api;
```

The app will automatically create the relations listed in `models.py` if not already created.

Run the app using `pipenv run flask run`

### Testing

A Postman collection has been provided for testing. After importing to Postman, remember to edit the Authorization token of the collection to use the JWT token generated by Auth0.

### Models

#### Database Patterns

- Guests can be invited to an Event (many to one)
- Guests must be invited through an Invite (many to one)
- An Event can have many Invites (one to many)
